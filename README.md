This was the final project of the core curriculum of 42 and was completed as part of a 5-person team. The goal was to create a website, chat system, and pong game in Typescript.\
\
Through this project we implemented:
- login and session cookies
- two-factor authentification
- chat system including PMs, chatrooms, mods and powers, friends and ignore lists
- a fighting-game-themed pong game with multiple game-modes and abilities
- a matchmaking system and ranking system
- customisable user profiles


We decided to use NestJS for the back-end and React for the front-end. For the database ORM we used TypeORM.
