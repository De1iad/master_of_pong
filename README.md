# master_of_pong

This was the final project of the core curriculum of 42. The goal was to create a website and Pong game using Typescript.\
I completed this project as part of a 5-person team.\
Through this project we implemented login, session cookies, two-factor authentification, a chat system, and matchmaking.\
We decided to use NestJS for the back-end and React for the front-end. For the database we used TypeORM.
